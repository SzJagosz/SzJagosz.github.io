# Welcome to The Azure Way

Hello there! I'm excited to welcome you to **The Azure Way** - a blog dedicated to all things Microsoft Azure and Terraform.

## What to Expect

This blog is designed to be a practical resource for cloud engineers, developers, and anyone interested in building and managing infrastructure in Azure. Here, you'll find:

- Step-by-step tutorials and walkthroughs
- Best practices for Azure and Terraform
- Solution architectures and design patterns
- Tips and tricks I've learned from real-world implementations
- Latest updates and features in the Azure ecosystem

## Why I Started This Blog

Cloud infrastructure has revolutionized how we build and deploy applications, but navigating the ever-expanding Azure service catalog and implementing infrastructure as code can be challenging.

Through my own journey with Azure and Terraform, I've gathered knowledge and experiences that I believe could help others. This blog is my way of contributing to the community and hopefully making your cloud journey a bit smoother.

## Coming Soon

In the upcoming weeks, I'll be publishing articles about:

- Setting up Terraform for Azure environments 
- Managing Azure resources efficiently with the Azure CLI
- Working with the Azure PowerShell module
- Automating deployments with CI/CD pipelines

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to feedback, suggestions, and discussions. If there are specific topics you'd like me to cover or if you have questions, feel free to reach out via [GitHub](https://github.com/szjagosz) or connect with me on LinkedIn.

Thank you for joining me on this cloud journey!
